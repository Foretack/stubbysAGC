### Changes:

someone pls remind to update this later

#### Additions:

`/blacklist [list|clear] <target>` -> Autobans anyone who joins with `<target>` in their name, e.g `/blacklist unbannable` will auto ban UNBANNABLE ROUTER CHAIN upon join. If `list` is found it will show the current blacklisted names. If `clear` is found it will clear the blacklisted names.

`/chatfilter [list|clear] <target word>` -> Autokicks anyone who sends a message containing specified word. Works exactly like blacklist but with kicks.

`/mute` -> mutes all warnings.

`/unmute` -> unmutes warnings.

`/lastalert` or `/la` -> sets freecam on the location of the last alert.

`/auto 6 [p] [la]` or `/a 6 [p] [la]` -> Goes to cursor. If `p` is found then use persist mode. If `la` is found then will take you to the coordinates of the last alert.

`/copy <target>` -> copies target raw name.

`/copyga <target>` -> copies target's actions log.

`/uuid <target> [--b | --l | --k]` or `/u <target> [--b | --l | --k]` -> copies target uuid. If `b` is found ban sytax will be copied. If `l` is found lookup sytax will be copied. If `k` is found kick sytax will be copied.  

`/lastuuid [b | l | k]` or `/lu [b | l | k]` -> copies the uuid of the last alerter. If `b` is found ban sytax will be copied. If `l` is found lookup sytax will be copied. If `k` is found kick sytax will be copied.
